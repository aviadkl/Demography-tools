# Demography modeling tools

This repository presents a set of functions for demography modeling. 

Functions are written in R.

List of functions:

1. Elandtâ€“Johnson Method for converting five-age mortality rates to single-age

2. Sprague multiplier function, extended to any last open age group (75+, 80+, 85+ etc.)

3. PAS interpolation algorithm that interpolates mortality rates from a range of two Mx vectors

4. Life Table function - complete or abridged. Holds two functions: I. life table by Mx input.  II. life table by qx input.
